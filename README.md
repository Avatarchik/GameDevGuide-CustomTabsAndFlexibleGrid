# GameDevGuide-CustomTabsAndFlexibleGrid
![Preview](Preview.gif)

- This project is my implementation of [Game Dev Guide](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR35rzd4LLomtQout93gi0w)'s excellent tutorials on custom tabs and flexible grid layouts in Unity.

- I created it using:
    - [Creating a Custom Tab System in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=211t6r12XPQ) 
    - [Making UI That Looks Good in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwdweCX5aMI) 
    - [Fixing Grid Layouts in Unity with a Flexible Grid Component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGsEJToeXmA&t=300s)
- It still lacks UI animation, but that's for another time.
- Both the tabs system and grid layout from  [Game Dev Guide](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR35rzd4LLomtQout93gi0w) are easy to implement and, more importantly, easy to re-use.
